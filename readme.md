Please build a simple application component / code snippet (please decide a good structure for your code) using Python and any open-source libraries, that extracts data elements (as 'key : value' pairs) from provided PDF forms and presents them to a user. The data elements should be configurable, but please choose a couple example elements to focus on. For example, given provided documents a data element might be 'customer name', 'branch name', 'claim type', or other. Create a small fit for purpose data model / tables to store relevant data required for the application to function & outputs. Create a simple UI (e.g. using Streamlit) to show the end-to-end process from document upload to extraction output being shown to the user. Consider extraction algorithm scalability, automated testing and error handling. We don't want perfection, but would like to see confidence, good practices and discussion on ways it could be improved. Please share the code with us only via a GitHub link.

During our interview: You will walk us through the code, and we will ask you follow-up questions, we might ask you to modify the code, add a simple feature or discuss expanding / enhancing the solution (60 minutes). Please make sure you can share your screen with where we can see the code in your IDE and the UI running. We will also discuss your career so far and ask a couple of competency questions (30 minutes).
